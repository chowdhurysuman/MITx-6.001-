Finger Exercise:1, correct choice is denoted by (>>>)

1.) What is the difference between an Algorithm and a Program?

>>>An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.correct
...An algorithm is limited to mathematical operation, a program can specify all kinds of operations.
...An algorithm makes a slow program run fast.
...An algorithm deals with computer hardware, a program deals with computer software.

2.) True or False? A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.

>>>True
...False

3.) True or False? Computer Science is the study of how to build efficient machines that run programs.

...True
>>>False

4.) The two things every computer can do are:

>>>Perform calculations
...Convert electricity to numbers
...Display results to a screen
>>>Remember the results

***True or False?

1.) Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact.

>>>True
...False

2.) Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.

>>>True
...False

3.) A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.

>>>True
...False

Finger Exercise:3, correct choice is denoted by (>>>)

1.) True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.

...True
>>>Falsecorrect

2.) True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.

...True
>>>Falsecorrect

3.) A program counter

...counts the number of primitive operations executed by the program.
...counts the number of primitive operations comprising a complex operation.
>>>points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program. correct
...remembers how many times a program has been executed.

4.) What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?

The computer tests each instruction to ensure it will not harm the circuitry.
The computer executes the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line.
The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence. correct
The computer slowly executes instructions so that we can follow its progress, rather than running a program at full speed.

5.)True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.

...True
>>>Falsecorrect

Note: The Python 'None' keyword
In Python, the keyword None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value.
None is the only value in Python of type NoneType.
